Hello from Mutex-Protected Multi-Client File Transfer Server!

This file is being transferred using:
✅ Multi-threading (pthread)
✅ Mutex synchronization (pthread_mutex)
✅ Shared resource protection
✅ Thread-safe statistics tracking
✅ File access coordination

Each client receives this file through a separate thread,
and all access to shared resources is protected by mutexes
to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.

Mutex concepts demonstrated:
- Critical sections
- Shared resource protection  
- Thread synchronization
- Deadlock prevention
- Resource management

Transfer statistics and file access are tracked in real-time
using mutex-protected shared data structures.

Enjoy your thread-safe file transfer!
